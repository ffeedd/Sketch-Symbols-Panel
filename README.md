# Sketch-Symbols-Panel


I had a lot of symbols，It's really inconvenient when i repeat insert them . 
I have a idea，and I designed an UI for it. 
but I don’t knowing how to code，Some people like to do?


All components are displayed as the finder，and you can drag the symbol into document.
some design shot in here.
